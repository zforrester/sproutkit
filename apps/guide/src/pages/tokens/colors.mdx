## Set up

Colors are defined in `tokens/colors.json`. By default, we have created a large list of colours, seperated by shade, but you can overwrite these values, replace the `$colors` list entirely, or extend it with your own definitions.

## Usage

Color values can be accessed by using the `color()` SCSS function, defined in `helpers/_colors.scss`. The function can receive two arguments, the `name` of the color, and the `opacity` value, from `0.0` to `1.0`.

For example

```
background-color: color('blue-800', .5)
```
